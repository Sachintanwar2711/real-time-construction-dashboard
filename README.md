# Real-Time Construction Monitoring Dashboard 🏗️

This project is a real-time dashboard system to monitor various aspects of construction projects including task progress, material usage, deadlines, and overall timeline.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (with Flask)
- **SQLite** (for database)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **Bootstrap** (for responsive design)
- **Chart.js / Google Charts** (for visualization – optional)

## 📌 Key Features

- Real-time tracking of construction project stages
- Task & milestone management
- Resource & material monitoring
- Project timeline visualization
- Simple UI with responsive design

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Backend:** Flask handles routes, API, and database interaction.
2. **Database:** SQLite stores task data, material logs, and updates.
3. **Frontend:** HTML templates display dynamic data from the backend.
4. **Visualization:** Project progress charts (bar, pie, timeline).
